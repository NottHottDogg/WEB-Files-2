          <p>I'm a student veteran finishing my undergrad this semester [Math Maj, TAM Minor].
            I've had some code exposure in the past, though wouldn't call myself a developer.
            I spend most of my free time flyfishing, or in winter snowboarding. Outside of class I've been developing a career in UX design and Systems Engineering with <a href="https://www.stratagemgroup.com/">The Stratagem Group </a> </p>
            <p>One day I hope to pick up one of <a href="Week-2-Web/index.html">these</a>, and learn to play like the master himself</p>
